# Maintenance-App

## Problem Statement
> With this mobile app, you can add photos and a brief description of the issues faced by individuals in private and public spaces. 
> The landlords/municipality can also monitor the reported issues and take appropriate actions to fix the problems. For instance, 
> house appliances in a rental property may stop working or vending machines in a building may not return the correct changes, and so on. 
> The handyman can also examine the problems and give quotes. The landlord and the handyman can communicate with each other through the app and agree 
> on a price and time for fixing the appliance(s). From the municipalities side, the users can report anything from a pothole on the road to not 
> correctly working vending machines and public washers/dryers. Each user can have a ranking or points based on how many useful reports they have 
> reported, how fast a landlord resolved the issue, and how reliably the handyman fixed the problem.
